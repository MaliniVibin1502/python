Being an aspiring Data Scientist this repository is self projects done on data received from Freecodecamp of the course Data Analyis with Python and Kaggle. Data is saved in csv files in the folder data and there are two db files chinook and sakila db. I have used Google Colab for coding and the libraries used are Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn within these projects. 
The projects included in this repository are:
- Demographic Data Analyser
- Used car Pricing
- Laptop pricing
- DVD store Sales analysis
- Nutrition analysis of Mc Donalds
- Medical Data analysis and Visualisation

Please ensure not to make any edits in the respository. You can download the files and refer to the codes that I have done however please do not edit the repository.
Happy coding!!
